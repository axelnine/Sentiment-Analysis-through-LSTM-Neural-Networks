# Sentiment Analysis through LSTM Neural Networks:

This repository contains code for a multi layer implementation of the LSTM Recurrent Neural Network for text classification. A good explanation of why LSTM(Long Short Term Memory Neural Networks) work better than RNNs is [here](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)

### Usage:

This code was used in continuation with the other GitHub repository on [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/axelnine/Sentiment-Analysis)
